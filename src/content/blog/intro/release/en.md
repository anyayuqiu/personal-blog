This project is currently under active maintenance. To update, follow these steps:

First, verify the version number in `package.json` or review the changelog here or at [Release](https://github.com/Motues/Momo/releases).

The project version number is only incremented when the configuration file structure undergoes structural changes. Project configuration files refer to those related to website layout and content, including `astro.config.mjs`, `src/config.ts`, `src/content.config.ts`, and files within the `src/i18n/` folder.

Blog text, images, and other content are stored in the `src/content/`, `src/assets`, and `public` folders.

## Version Number Unchanged

You can directly clone this project, then overwrite the new project with your original configuration files. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies, followed by `pnpm build` for local compilation. Finally, execute `pnpm preview` to preview the compiled project.

When updating inside this repository, run `pnpm momo update`: it reads the latest [release](https://github.com/Motues/Momo/releases), compares it with the version in `package.json`, downloads that version's source, **keeps your own posts and images** (`src/content`, `src/assets`, `public`) and `src/config.ts`, overwrites the rest of the code and installs dependencies, then lists the **configuration files that need to be merged by hand**. Run `pnpm momo update --dry-run` first to preview the changes; overwritten files are saved under `.backup/update-<timestamp>/overwritten/`, and `pnpm momo restore <backup name>` rolls the configuration back.

## Version Number Changed

Whenever the version number changes, the modification log will be updated here. Refer to the specific log entries to modify the corresponding configuration files.

Below are general modification suggestions.

* **`astro.config.mjs` Modifications**: Typically just overwrite the file. Its `site` and `i18n` fields are read from `siteConfig.rootSiteUrl`, `i18nConfig.defaultLanguage` and `i18nConfig.supportedLanguages` in `src/config.ts`.
* **`config.ts` Modifications**: Update `config.ts` by adding or modifying configuration items as required.
* **`content.config.ts` Modifications**: Typically involves adding new frontmatter configurations to articles. Add the required new configuration items to articles as specified.
* **`src/i18n/` Modifications**: Generally involves adding new internationalization translations; simply overwrite the files. Note that the Cover text of each page (`cover.title` / `cover.subTitle`) has moved into `i18nConfig.translations` in `src/config.ts` — edit it there.

## Version Information

> Version numbers follow the `YY.MM.DD` format

### 26.9.27

* The collage row height is now **computed per row**: the widest image (largest aspect ratio) decides it and is shown in full, while the other images of the row are cropped to that height
* Collages **no longer show the caption under each image**; the lightbox now reads the image `title` instead
* The collage reads image aspect ratios at build time: relative paths and `/public` paths are read from disk, while remote images are fetched as a header only (512 KB max, 5 s timeout, 6 concurrent); on failure the row height comes from the other images
* The **lightbox can now shrink images down to 50%**, and the matching buttons are disabled at 50% and 800%
* `pnpm momo update` no longer updates `.github`, `.vscode` or `.idea`
* Fixed cover images with an uppercase extension (e.g. `.JPG`) not being found
* This update only changes `astro.config.mjs` (the collage gained the `public` directory lookup), so simply overwrite it

### 26.9.26

* New **automatic image collage**: consecutive images in the content are laid out as a grid and still open full size in the lightbox
* `pnpm momo update` is now **release-based**: it no longer depends on local git and keeps your own posts, images and `src/config.ts`
* Front-end smoothness work: reduced the home page's blocking stylesheet and fixed the listener pile-up and the entrance animation dying after a client-side navigation
* New `pnpm momo audit` command for re-measuring the first-paint cost of a build
* The CMS "Site config" page gained the collage switch and the per-row limit
* This update modifies the `src/config.ts` configuration file by adding the `theme.imageCollage` field; you must add this new field when updating, while every other file can simply be overwritten

### 26.9.25

* Code blocks switched to the official **Expressive Code** integration, with title bars, line highlighting, diff markers, line numbers, collapsible sections and a copy button; the switch and code theme live in `siteConfig.expressiveCode` in `src/config.ts`
* The image lightbox is now self-built (no longer depending on `photoswipe`): wheel / button / double-click / pinch zoom, drag to pan, arrow keys or swipe to switch, Esc to close, with fly-in and fly-out animations
* The CMS gained a "Site config" page (`#/config`) for editing `src/config.ts` visually; the archive page is now server-rendered
* SEO improvements: canonical, hreflang, Open Graph / Twitter Cards, structured data, `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`
* This update modifies the `astro.config.mjs` configuration file, adds the new config file `ec.config.mjs` and adds `siteConfig.expressiveCode` to `src/config.ts`; it also changes the dependencies (adds `astro-expressive-code`, removes `photoswipe`), so add the new fields and run `pnpm install` when updating

### 26.9.10

> This update contains **breaking configuration changes**. Please read the release notes below carefully!

* Standardized the `config.ts` configuration file to centrally manage the default language, supported languages, and cover text for each page

    * `src/config.ts`: Added `i18nConfig` and added `rootSiteUrl` to `siteConfig`
    * `src/i18n/language/*.ts`: Removed the original `cover` field; now referenced from `config.ts`
    * `astro.config.mjs`: Updated the `site` and `i18n` sections to reference the configuration in `src/config.ts`
* After the update, you’ll need to clear the local cache (`node_modules`, `.astro`, `dist`) and run `pnpm install` again. You can use `pnpm momo clean --all` to do this quickly
